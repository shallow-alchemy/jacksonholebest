# About Jackson Hole Best

## Where Adventure Meets Great Food

Jackson Hole Best is the definitive dining guide for outdoor enthusiasts who refuse to compromise on great food. We're the first guide to bridge the gap between Jackson's incredible outdoor adventures and its equally impressive culinary scene.

## Our Story

After multiple trips exploring Grand Teton National Park and Jackson Hole's incredible outdoor offerings, we found ourselves frustrated by dining guides that either focused on budget tourist traps or intimidating fine dining with no middle ground. We wanted thoughtful recommendations that understood that after a 12-mile hike, you need more than a protein barâ€”but you also don't want to spend hours researching restaurants.

That's why we created Jackson Hole Best: **30-50 carefully curated restaurants** that deliver exceptional experiences across every price point, from post-hike fuel to celebration dinners.

## What Makes Us Different

**Adventure-Focused Curation**  
Unlike generic travel sites with hundreds of listings, we organize dining around your outdoor experiences. Whether you need quick energy before hitting the trails, hearty refueling after a powder day, or a memorable dinner to cap off your adventure, we've got you covered.

**Complete Price Transparency**  
We provide clear pricing levels and honest value assessments because your adventure budget matters. From $10 trail lunches to $100 celebration dinners, every recommendation includes practical cost guidance.

**Thorough Research, Professional Quality**  
We combine comprehensive research with detailed, well-crafted descriptions. Our research process includes calling restaurants directly, reading hundreds of recent reviews, and gathering the insider details that make each place special.

**Park Integration**  
We're the only guide that seamlessly connects Jackson town dining with Grand Teton National Park experiences, including distance from park entrances and what meals work best for different outdoor itineraries.
