Here's the template format for competitive analysis:

```
Site Name	Total Restaurants	Category 1	Category 2	Category 3	Category 4	Category 5	Strengths	Weaknesses	Opportunities
[Site Name]	[Number]	[Category]	[Category]	[Category]	[Category]	[Category]	[Strength 1 | Strength 2 | Strength 3]	[Weakness 1 | Weakness 2 | Weakness 3]	[Opportunity 1 | Opportunity 2 | Opportunity 3]
```

**Instructions for use:**
- **Site Name:** The website/article you're analyzing
- **Total Restaurants:** Count of restaurants featured
- **Categories 1-5:** Main organizational categories they use (add more columns if needed)
- **Strengths:** What they do well (separate with | )
- **Weaknesses:** What's missing or poorly done (separate with | )
- **Opportunities:** Gaps you can exploit to do better (separate with | )

This template will help you systematically analyze each competitor and identify patterns across multiple sites to inform your content strategy. 

Note that the table format must be something I can click copy on so that I can paste it elsewhere
