Jackson Hole Dining Guide Strategy Summary
Key Strengths to Leverage

Coverage sweet spot: 30-50 curated restaurants (vs competitors' 6-20 or TripAdvisor's overwhelming 158+)
Adventure travel integration: No competitor successfully combines outdoor focus with dining
Full price spectrum: Most focus either budget-only or luxury-only
Authentic experience + professional quality: Combine personal travel stories with polished presentation

Major Weaknesses to Avoid

Missing practical info: Lack of pricing, dietary restrictions, reservation details
Poor visuals: Weak food photography compared to luxury competitors
Single-focus bias: Wine-only, health-only, or luxury-only approaches limit audience
Town vs park separation: Most ignore Grand Teton dining integration

Biggest Opportunities

Adventure dining niche: Own the "outdoor enthusiasts who want great food" space
Price transparency: First guide with clear pricing levels and value assessments
Activity-based organization: "Post-Hike Fuel," "Celebration Dinners," "Quick Park Lunches"
Local + tourist appeal: Combine insider credibility with broader upscale coverage
Content depth: Detailed descriptions for 3-4x more restaurants with better photography

Winning Formula
30-50 restaurants + Adventure focus + All price points + Practical details + Great visuals + Park integration
This combination doesn't exist in the current competitive landscape.
